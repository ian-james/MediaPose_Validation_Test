# Shoulder Flexion along x-axis 0 at rest, 180 straight,
# Shoulder Extension 60 backward, 0 at rest
# Elbow Flexion (along x-axis) 90 at rest, 0 bend elbow, 60 full curl

# Internal Rotation - 0 arm straight out and wrist up, 90 by side wrist up,
# External Rotation - 0 arm straight out 0 and 90 straight up.

# Horizontal Abduction and Adduction (y-axis rotation, arm straight along x-axis thumb- rest 0, straight arm in-front thumb up 90)
# Abduction and Adjuction (z-axis rotation arm down by side is rest 0, straight out to side is 90, above head palm out 180)

<TODO - Feb 8>

1) Abduction rest is currently 90, set to 0.
2) Consider initial position with an error rate. If rest is 15 degrees, then error might.
This is a personalized ROM.

3) Shoulder Center y-axis straight line ( future considerations )

4) Frame FPS 0.03 in dartfish - We want to be able to compare frames on the same image.
   Should be writing as excel file. 
   Should be images at same capture fps.

5) Plan for long-term website.

6) Keeping Tips and process for Media Pipe

7) Compare two videos in multiple Overiew and frontal.


# Demo Comments
# Calibrate in neutral position, where is the axis for their initial position.
# Consideration for the starting points between normal Range-of-Motion and patients.
# Further investigate depth as Z-Axis is calculated via ML. How accurate is it?
# Validations  - Gold standard against ours ( DartFish or OptiTrack etc)
# Standard starting position for exercises.
# Goals rely on evaluating tele-health types solutions based on quick assessment (guess-estimate)
# However, this has potential as low entry points for cost, setup, and now requires validation for accuracy.

My TODO:
# Saving is not appending the dataframe anymore (this might be a merge issue) (Might only occur on another error.)
# Working on calculation for the flexion as it isn't right.


Shoulder flexion is rotation around the x-axix (extension is negative rotation)
Shoulder Add/abduction are are around the z-axis

# TODO
# (Done) Remove the everythign but Flexsion and Abduction
# Front Frame Analysis Only

# Full Body Analysis - Appears to work but negative.
# (Done) Key Points - Only Flex and Abudction.

# (Done) Color Swap on Video Files (Important then Camera)
# (Done) Resize Image and Videos
